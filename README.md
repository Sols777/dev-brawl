Hi there ðŸ‘‹! I am Luis

## DevBrawl:
> This project was my final project @LeWagon Porto bootcamp together with 2 other junior devs from the bootcamp.
## What is it about:
<p>
  DevBrawl is a platform for developers to compete against each other. This can be done in 6 different languages, 
  each with different challenges to complete. There's the game mode time trial where there's an IDE coded to appear for the language you selected. 
  On that page, there's also a timer and instructions on what you are supposed to do to complete the challenge. After that, if it's correct, 
  you gain the points associated with that challenge, which are added to your score. You can view your score on your profile or on our main leaderboard,  
  which displays the top 5 highest scores. It also registers your time if it's correct and adds it to the best times leaderboard. 
  The more challenges you complete, the higher your completion percentage of the total available challenges per language.
